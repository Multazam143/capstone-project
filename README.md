# About this Capstone Project
Plantgard is a mobile app that leverages AI and cloud computing to help Indonesian farmers detect crop diseases quickly and accurately by analyzing crop images. Initially focused on corn, the app provides treatment recommendations to reduce losses and improve yields. With plans to expand to more crops and optimize performance for on-device AI, Plantgard empowers farmers with precision agriculture tools accessible through their smartphones.
